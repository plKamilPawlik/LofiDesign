# LofiDesign

**LofiDesign** is a small collection of customizations I use for my daily
programming setup. It consists of:

- **Iosevka Lofi** -> a personalized monospace font build
- **Lofi Dark (VS Code)** -> a custom Visual Studio Code theme
- **Lofi Dark (Windows Terminal)** -> a matching Windows Terminal color scheme

The idea behind LofiDesign is to keep my coding environment **minimal,
consistent, and calm**, inspired by the fonts and themes I enjoyed using in the
past (like Hack, Menlo, and Dark+).

## âœ¨ Projects included

- [**Iosevka Lofi**](/Iosevka) A custom build of the Iosevka font, based on
  Menlo-style glyphs (ss04) with adjustments inspired by Hack. Optimized for
  programming, terminals, and text editing.

- [**Lofi Dark (VS Code)**](/VisualStudioCode) A personal theme for Visual
  Studio Code. It reuses the original Dark/Dark+/Dark Modern token colors from
  the VS Code source and applies a slightly modified editor background.

- [**Lofi Dark (Windows Terminal)**](/WindowsTerminal) A Windows Terminal scheme
  based on Dark+, modified only to match the background color of the VS Code
  Lofi Dark theme.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository contains three main folders:

- `/Iosevka` -> font build plan and prebuilt font files
- `/VisualStudioCode` -> VS Code theme sources and preview builds
- `/WindowsTerminal` -> Windows Terminal theme definitions

## ðŸš¦ Disclaimer

This is a **personal project**. I created it for my own daily use, but decided
to share it publicly in case it inspires or helps others.

- These are **not official themes or distributions**.
- Some parts are based on original projects from Microsoft (VS Code themes,
  Windows Terminal Dark+ scheme) and follow their respective licenses.
- I do not plan to publish them to official marketplaces.

## ðŸ“œ License

Each subproject inherits the license of its original base:

- **Iosevka Lofi** -> SIL Open Font License 1.1 (from Iosevka)
- **Lofi Dark (VS Code)** -> MIT License (from VS Code source)
- **Lofi Dark (Windows Terminal)** -> MIT License (from Windows Terminal source)
