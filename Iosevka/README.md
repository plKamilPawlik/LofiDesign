# Iosevka Lofi

**Iosevka Lofi** is a personalized build of the
[Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka) font. It combines the **Menlo Style (ss04)
glyphs** with selected adjustments inspired by **Hack**, resulting in a clean,
minimal, and highly readable monospace font.

## âœ¨ Concept

Iosevka Lofi was originally created for my personal use. I enjoyed Hack for its
shapes, but it had a few drawbacks for me. With Iosevkaâ€™s build system, I was
able to fine-tune the design to get exactly what I wanted:

- Mostly Menlo-inspired (ss04) base
- Adjusted characters closer to Hack style
- Optimized for programming, terminals, and text editing
