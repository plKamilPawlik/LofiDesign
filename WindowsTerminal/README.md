# Lofi Dark (Windows Terminal Theme)

**Lofi Dark** is a Windows Terminal color scheme derived from the official
**Dark+** palette. It is designed to visually align with the **Lofi Dark** VS
Code theme by applying a matching background color.

## âœ¨ Concept

This theme is a minimal modification of the built-in Dark+ scheme. The ANSI
color palette remains identical to Dark+, while only the **background color**
was adjusted to match the VS Code **Lofi Dark** theme.

- Foreground/ANSI colors -> unchanged (from Dark+)
- Background color -> aligned with Lofi Dark (VS Code)

## ðŸ“‚ Project structure

This folder contains:

- `themes` -> theme definitions for Windows Terminal
- `settings/settings.json` -> example configuration for a quickstart setup

## ðŸ›  Installation

To use the theme:

1. Open your Windows Terminal `settings.json` (you can open it via `Ctrl+,` ->
   top-right dropdown -> _Open JSON file_).
2. Copy the contents of one of the theme `.json` files into the `"schemes"`
   section.
